    <h1>Biryani</h1>
    <p>Biryani can be an elaborate, ambitious affair, packed with layer upon layer of spiced meat and vegetables all steaming together with ghee. This version is simplified, with just two layers—marinated chicken thighs and parboiled basmati—cooked together in a heavy-lidded dutch oven to keep all the steam (and flavor) locked in. Because biryani is all about the rice, this is the time to splurge on some extra-long, premium aged basmati. (You might need to go beyond your local supermarket and search online or at a specialty store.) Look for rice with a golden hue which indicates that it has been properly aged and ensures fluffy, distinct, fragrant grains.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>½ tsp. sugar</li>
        <li>1½ cups whole-milk yogurt divided</li>
        <li>3 tsp. kosher salt, divided</li>
<li>1 tsp. fresh ground black pepper, divided</li>
<li>1 red onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely grate 1 tsp. lemon zest into a small bowl. Squeeze in juice from one half of the lemon. Add sugar, 1 cup yogurt, 1 tsp. salt, and ¼ tsp. pepper. Finely chop one-quarter of the onion and stir into raita. Let sit at room temperature at least 1 hour or chill up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Purée ginger, garlic, cinnamon, cardamom, juice of remaining lemon half, and remaining three-quarters of onion, ½ cup yogurt, 2 tsp. salt, and ¾ tsp. pepper in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Using your hands, pull skin off chicken thighs and discard. (Don’t worry about any straggly bits of skin and fat; they will render out during cooking.) Transfer to bowl with ginger mixture, add bay leaves, and toss to combine. Cover with a plate and let marinate at room temperature at least 2 hours or preferably chill up to overnight.</li>
        <li>Place a rack in lower third of oven; preheat to 350°. Bring salt and 3 qt. water to a rapid boil in a large pot over high heat.</li>
    </ol>
